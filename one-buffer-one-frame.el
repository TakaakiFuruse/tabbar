;; DESCRIPTION:
;; 
;; Always open new frames for each new buffer and switch to their frame.
;; In this minor mode, buffers are usually displayed in their own frames.
;; All buffer switching functions available to users will raise the
;; frame that shows the buffer. Deletion of the frame (or window) usually
;; kills the associated buffer, unless the buffer is still shown in another
;; window or it is a special-purpose buffer such as `*Messages*'.
;;
;; To enable, add this to your init file:
;; (one-buffer-one-frame-mode t)

  "Always open new frames for each new buffer and switch to their frame.
In this minor mode, buffers are usually displayed in their own frames.
All buffer switching functions available to users will raise the
frame that shows the buffer. Deletion of the frame (or window) usually
kills the associated buffer, unless the buffer is still shown in another
window or it is a special-purpose buffer such as `*Messages*'. 

This minor mode provides some additional key bindings:

C-x B         `switch-to-buffer-here'
C-x S-left    `prev-buffer-here'
C-x S-right   `next-buffer-here'
C-x C-B       `list-buffers-here'

The mode sets `pop-up-frames', `pop-up-windows', 
`display-buffer-reuse-frames'.

This mode is part of Aquamacs Emacs, http://aquamacs.org."
